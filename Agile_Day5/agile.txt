Planning --
What the users want , what to build to address those needs.
Requirements Elicitation - is the process of discovering user needs and writing them down as user requirements.

Requirement Analysis is the process of prioritizing user requirements from various sources and defining what to build as a product 
Feasibility 
Requirement Specification Document
Functional Requirements and non Functional Requirements

Design Phase , diagrams, pictures, charts 
use case diagrams

Modularity 
Cohesion and coupling
Good modular system should have loose coupling and high cohesion with modules 
Dependency injection

A module has a cohesion if the module has one responsibility and all its elements relate to that responsibility



Agile is a set of  methods and methodologies that help your team to think more effectively , work more efficiently and make better decisions

Agile is also mindset .

Agile is fundamentally a mindset, a way of thinking about work that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, continuous learning, and rapid adaptation to change, rather than just a rigid set of processes or rules.

The 4 Core Agile Values
Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools: Values people and how they work together more than rigid processes or specific tools, recognizing that good communication drives success.
Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation: Prioritizes delivering functional, valuable software to customers quickly over extensive upfront documentation, which can become outdated.
Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation: Focuses on ongoing partnership with the customer throughout the project, rather than being locked into initial, inflexible contracts.
Responding to Change Over Following a Plan: Embraces changing requirements, even late in development, to provide the customer with a competitive advantage, instead of rigidly adhering to an initial plan.

SPRINT 


 
 
In Agile, project velocity is a metric measuring how much work a development team completes per iteration (sprint), usually in story points, to help with planning, forecasting timelines, and identifying process improvements, not for comparing teams. It's calculated by summing the points of completed user stories, providing a stable baseline for a team's capacity, revealing trends, and setting realistic goals for future sprints. 

Project managers track task board, project velocity and burndown charts

task board, project velocity, user story point , burndown chart, burnup chart

Sprint planning 
1.start with the most valuable user stories from the product backlog

Take a story in that list -
Discuss with the team 
 keep going going through the stories until you have accumulated enough points to fill the spring
